            The virus is spread primarily via nose and mouth secretions including small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually do not travel through air over long distances.
            On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.

        <p> The impact of the coronavirus pandemic is causing everywhere including emerging technologies, socio-demographic shifts,political and economic uncertainty.In fact,the Covid-19 pandemic has sent countries around the world into crisis mode. 
        During the lockdown we have adapted quickly to new ways of working,learnt new skills,explored our new interest apart from the daily routine,new ideas to the business and so on.One of the most important threads in the adaptation story is the role of technology and the internet.
        The use of digital technology is somehow helping us to fight against pandemic in various ways.</p>

        <p>
        During this pandemic,businesses, education, government bodies, and organizations across the country have been going remote to help avoid some of the worst possible health consequences. Digital connections allow officers to work at home instead of the office,students to study via virtual classes,customers to order and pay bills online greatly reducing the risk of transmission.
        Widespread adoption of the internet and web applications have made it easier than ever to do our jobs in virtually any location. Whether it's conducting research, updating a spreadsheet, designing a new logo, marketing a product, or providing customer service, most day-to-day tasks can now be done from the safety of one’s home. 
        People in many professions have found that they’re able accomplish just about anything they can in a regular office.</p>

        <p>Video conferencing may be one of the most obvious and direct innovations that enable social distancing over extended periods of time. Not only has video conferencing made it significantly less burdensome for many businesses to continue functioning with a largely remote workforce, it also provides people with much needed face-to-face interaction. 
        In addition, video conferencing platforms allow schools and universities to continue educating their students virtually while they are not able to meet in an actual classroom.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
        Before the pandemic, only 30% employees worked remotely 100% of the time,For the other 70% they were dependent on regular office or worksite.
        But the silver lining is that high percentage of the working population now remote, digital collaboration is improving in leaps and bounds, both in terms of the sophistication of the tools to facilitate it and workers’ level of comfort with it.</p>
        
        <p>In summary, Digital technology helps us to work remotely,pay our utility bills online, study virtually, increase business and customer interaction remotely and smoothly,perform online banking, access digital health solutions and many more. So, we can conclude that the pace of use of digital technology has increased rapidly during this Covid-19 pandemic due to its efficiency,reliability,security and agility.</p>
